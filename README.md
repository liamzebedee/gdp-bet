===========

Idea: Bet the next US GDP print, paid in USDC.

Users mint two tokensâ€”LONG_GDP and SHORT_GDPâ€”by depositing USDC into a single, fully-collateralized vault. When BEA posts the quarterâ€™s GDP change on-chain, the vault is split between longs and shorts by a simple bounded rule tied to the % change. No new money is created; winners are paid from losers.

Example: vault 200 USDC. GDP +2% â†’ longs get 120, shorts 80. GDP âˆ’1% â†’ longs 90, shorts 110. Before the print, both tokens trade in an AMM so you can enter/exit on expectations.
